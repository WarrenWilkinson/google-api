* Google Cloud API For Emacs

This is an emacs library of Google Cloud API routines. They are generated
using Googles discovery documents.

https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/building-a-client-library
https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis
https://developers.google.com/api-client-library


Master branch will contain the code for the discovery document
processor only.  Release branch will contain that and all the generated
elisp files for the google APIs.
